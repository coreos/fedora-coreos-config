# This lockfile should be used to pin to a package version (`type: pin`) or to
# fast-track packages ahead of Bodhi (`type: fast-track`). Fast-tracked
# packages will automatically be removed once they are in the stable repos.
#
# IMPORTANT: YAML comments *will not* be preserved. All `pin` overrides *must*
# include a URL in the `metadata.reason` key. Overrides of type `fast-track`
# *should* include a Bodhi update URL in the `metadata.bodhi` key and a URL
# in the `metadata.reason` key, though it's acceptable to omit a `reason`
# for FCOS-specific packages (ignition, afterburn, etc.).
