    # In order to make chrony use NTP settings from DHCP 
    # (https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-config/pull/412), we need 
    # to chmod the following files to unset the writable permissions.
    # Git tracks only the executable bit of the permissions so when
    # the files get pulled locally they could have the group write bit set.
    # When that happens we get an error like:
    # `Cannot execute '/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/20-coreos-chrony-dhcp': writable by group or other`
