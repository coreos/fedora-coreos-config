# Hardcode persistent journal by default. journald has this "auto" behaviour
# that only makes logs persistent if `/var/log/journal` exists, which it won't
# on first boot because `/var` isn't fully populated. We should be able to get
# rid of this once we move to sysusers and create the dir in the initrd.
