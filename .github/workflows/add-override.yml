# This workflow could almost use the default GITHUB_TOKEN, if we were to
# push the branch into this repo.  However, GitHub Actions has recursion
# avoidance that would prevent CI from running on the PR:
#
# https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/blob/28fa4848947e/docs/concepts-guidelines.md#workarounds-to-trigger-further-workflow-runs
#
# So we create the PR using a separate Personal Access Token in
# COREOSBOT_RELENG_TOKEN, belonging to a machine account.  That allows CI to
# run when the PR is first created.  However, it's also possible to rerun
# the workflow and have it force-push the branch, reusing the same PR.  In
# that case the push also cannot come from GITHUB_TOKEN, or CI will not
# rerun.  Thus we also do the push using COREOSBOT_RELENG_TOKEN.  Since we
# don't want to give the machine account privileges to this repo, we push
# to a forked repo owned by the machine account.
