# Fedora CoreOS Release Note

This directory stores the Fedora CoreOS release note yaml snippets which will be picked up by
`fedora-coreos-releng-automation/coreos-release-note-generator` [1] script to produce the final
`release-notes.yaml` for a release. After `release-notes.yaml` has been generated / updated,
all snippets under `release-notes.d` are expected to be cleaned up for future release notes.

Please name the yaml file with the corresponding project name, e.g. afterburn.yaml, since the project name
is determined by the yaml file name. And the release notes for a specfic version will be sorted by different
project sections on the FCOS download website. For example, in the FCOS download website:

---
32.20200715.3.0:
 - Afterburn: fix a bug that prevents xxx (https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/789) (details)
 - Ignition: introduce a new feature that improves the yyy workflow (details)
 - coreos-assembler: add a new sub-command that automates zzz (details)
---

_Note_: Clicking on the `details` button will show the body of the release note item.
