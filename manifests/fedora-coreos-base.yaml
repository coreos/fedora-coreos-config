# into one of the sub-manifests listed at the top.
packages:
  # Security
  - polkit
  # Containers
  - systemd-container catatonit

  # support for old style CNI networks and name resolution for

  - containernetworking-plugins podman-plugins dnsmasq
  # For podman v4 netavark gets pulled in but it only recommends
  # aardvark-dns (which provides name resolution based on container
  # names). This functionality was previously provided by dnsname from
  # podman-plugins in the podman v3 stack.
  # See https://github.com/containers/netavark/pull/217
  - aardvark-dns
  # Since we need `containernetworking-plugins` installed to continue
  # to support CNI networks we need to also explicitly install
  # `netavark` so we get both of them installed since both of them
  # provide `container-network-stack`.
