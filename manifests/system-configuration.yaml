  # There are things that write outside of the journal still (such as the
  # classic wtmp, etc.). auditd also writes outside the journal but it has its
  # own log rotation.
  # Anything package layered will also tend to expect files dropped in
  # /etc/logrotate.d to work. Really, this is a legacy thing, but if we don't
  # have it then people's disks will slowly fill up with logs.
