# This minimal base starts just from: kernel + systemd + rpm-ostree + bootloader.
# The intent of this is to inherit from this if you are doing something highly
# custom that e.g. might not involve Ignition or podman, but you do want
# rpm-ostree.
# We expect most people though using coreos-assembler to inherit from
# fedora-coreos-base.yaml.

 # Kernel + systemd.  Note we explicitly specify kernel-{core,modules}
 # because otherwise depsolving could bring in kernel-debug.
