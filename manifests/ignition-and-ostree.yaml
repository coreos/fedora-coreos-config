# Defines the "core" of a Fedora CoreOS like system; basically (ignition, ostree)
# plus other default tweaks.  Things in this file should be something we expect
# basically everyone using both Ignition and (rpm-)ostree to want.
# It may be used as an inheritance base by other projects like Fedora Silverblue or RHCOS.
# One good model is to add fedora-coreos-config as a git submodule.  See:
# https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler/pull/639

packages:
  - ignition
  - dracut-network
