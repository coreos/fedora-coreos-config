= Configuring Swap on ZRAM

In Fedora 33 some editions https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/33/ChangeSet#swap_on_zram[enabled swap on ZRAM by default]. Fedora CoreOS currently has the `zram-generator` included but no configuration in place to enable swap on ZRAM by default. In order to configure swap on ZRAM you can lay down a configuration file via Ignition that will tell the zram generator to set up swap on top of a zram device.

The documentation for the config file format lives in the https://github.com/systemd/zram-generator/blob/main/man/zram-generator.conf.md[upstream documentation] along with a comprehensive https://github.com/systemd/zram-generator/blob/main/zram-generator.conf.example[example]. The most basic form of a configuration file that will set up a `zram0` device for swap is:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
variant: fcos
version: {butane-latest-stable-spec}
storage:
  files:
    - path: /etc/systemd/zram-generator.conf
      mode: 0644
      contents:
        inline: |
          # This config file enables a /dev/zram0 device with the default settings
          [zram0]
----

Once booted, you can verify the swap device is set up by viewing the `swapon --show` output. You can also view the true compression ratio of the currently configured zram devices by running `zramctl`.
