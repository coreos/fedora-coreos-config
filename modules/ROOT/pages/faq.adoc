further, join us in our Matrix room,
link:https://chat.fedoraproject.org/#/room/#coreos:fedoraproject.org[#coreos:fedoraproject.org],
or on our https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/coreos[discussion board].
Please refer back here as some questions and answers will likely get
updated.

== What is Fedora CoreOS?

Fedora CoreOS is an automatically updating, minimal, monolithic,
container-focused operating system, designed for clusters but also
operable standalone, optimized for Kubernetes but also great without it.
Its goal is to provide the best container host to run containerized
workloads securely and at scale.

== How does Fedora CoreOS relate to RHEL CoreOS?

Fedora CoreOS is a freely available, community distribution that is the
upstream basis for RHEL CoreOS. While Fedora CoreOS embraces a
variety of containerized use cases, RHEL CoreOS provides a
focused OS for OpenShift, released and life-cycled in tandem
with the platform.

== What are the communication channels around Fedora CoreOS?

We have the following new communication channels around Fedora CoreOS:

* Mailing list: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/coreos@lists.fedoraproject.org/[coreos@lists.fedoraproject.org]
* Operational notices for Fedora CoreOS: https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/coreos-status@lists.fedoraproject.org/[coreos-status@lists.fedoraproject.org]
* Matrix: https://chat.fedoraproject.org/#/room/#coreos:fedoraproject.org[#coreos:fedoraproject.org]
* Forum at https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/tag/coreos
* Website at https://fedoraproject.org/coreos/
* Twitter at https://twitter.com/fedoracoreos[@fedoracoreos] (Fedora CoreOS news), https://twitter.com/fedora[@fedora] (all Fedora and other relevant news)

There is a community meeting that happens every week. See the https://calendar.fedoraproject.org/CoreOS/[Fedora CoreOS fedocal] for the most up-to-date information.

If you think you have found a problem with Fedora CoreOS, file an issue in our https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues[issue tracker].

== Where can I download Fedora CoreOS?

Fedora CoreOS artifacts are available at https://fedoraproject.org/en/coreos/download/[fedoraproject.org].

== Does Fedora CoreOS update itself automatically?

Yes, Fedora CoreOS comes with automatic
updates and regular releases. Multiple update channels are provided
catering to different users' needs. Fedora CoreOS provides a node-update
service based on rpm-ostree technologies, with a server component that
can be optionally self-hosted.

== How are Fedora CoreOS nodes provisioned? Can I re-use existing cloud-init configurations?

Fedora CoreOS is provisioned with Ignition. Existing cloud-init
configurations are not supported and will need to be migrated into their
Ignition equivalent.

== What data persists across upgrades and reboots?

The directories `/etc` and `/var` are mounted as read-write which lets users
write and modify files.

The directory `/etc` may be changed by deployments, but will not override user
made changes. The content under `/var` is left untouched by rpm-ostree when
applying upgrades or rollbacks. For more information, refer to the
https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/storage/#_mounted_filesystems[Mounted Filesystems]
section.

== Which container runtimes are available on Fedora CoreOS?

Fedora CoreOS includes Docker and podman by default.
Based on community engagement and support this list could
change over time.

== Can I run Kubernetes on Fedora CoreOS?

Yes. However, Fedora CoreOS does not include a specific container
orchestrator (or version of Kubernetes) by default.

== How do I run custom applications on Fedora CoreOS?

On Fedora CoreOS, containers are the way to install and configure any
software not provided by the base operating system. The package layering
mechanism provided by rpm-ostree will continue to exist for use in
debugging a Fedora CoreOS machine, but we strongly discourage its use.
For more about this, please refer to xref:running-containers.adoc[documentation].

== Where is my preferred tool for troubleshooting?

The FCOS image is kept minimal by design. Not every troubleshooting tool are
included by default. Instead, it is recommended to use the `toolbox` utility.

xref:debugging-with-toolbox.adoc[Debugging with Toolbx].

== How do I coordinate cluster-wide OS updates?

The Zincati update manager includes a
https://coreos.github.io/zincati/usage/updates-strategy/#lock-based-strategy[lock-based updates strategy]
that supports multiple backends.

OKD's https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator[Machine Config Operator (MCO)]
automatically handles updates of Fedora CoreOS in OKD clusters.
The MCO additionally covers reconciliation of machine configuration changes.

== How do I upload Fedora CoreOS to private AWS EC2 regions?

Fedora CoreOS today is only uploaded to the standard AWS regions. For regions
in other AWS partitions like GovCloud and AWS China, you must upload the images
yourself.

Note that Fedora CoreOS uses a unified BIOS/UEFI partition layout. As such, it
is not compatible with the `aws ec2 import-image` API (for more information,
see https://github.com/openshift/os/pull/396[related discussions]). Instead,
you must use `aws ec2 import-snapshot` combined with `aws ec2 register-image`.

To learn more about these APIs, see the AWS documentation for
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-import-snapshot.html[importing snapshots]
and
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html#creating-launching-ami-from-snapshot[creating EBS-backed AMIs].

== Can I run containers via docker and podman at the same time?

No. Running containers via `docker` and `podman` at the same time can cause
issues and unexpected behavior. We highly recommend against trying to use them
both at the same time.

It is worth noting that in Fedora CoreOS we have `docker.service`
disabled by default but it is easily started if anything communicates
with the `/var/run/docker.sock` because `docker.socket` is enabled by
default. This means that if a user runs any `docker` command (via
`sudo docker`) then the daemon will be activated.

In https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/408[coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker#408]
it was pointed out that because of socket activation users who are
using `podman` for containers could unintentionally start the docker
daemon. This could weaken the security of the system because of the
interaction of both container runtimes with the firewall on the system.
To prevent making this mistake you can disable `docker` completely by
masking the `docker.service` systemd unit.

.Example Butane config for disabling docker.service
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
variant: fcos
version: {butane-latest-stable-spec}
systemd:
  units:
    - name: docker.service
      mask: true
----

== Are Fedora CoreOS x86_64 disk images hybrid BIOS+UEFI bootable?

The x86_64 images we provide can be used for either BIOS (legacy) boot or UEFI boot. They contain a hybrid BIOS/UEFI partition setup that allows them to be used for either. The exception to that is the `metal4k` 4k native image, which is targeted at disks with 4k sectors and https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler/blob/12029fea7798fa5d3535eafcf8c3d02f9a6095e4/src/cmd-buildextend-metal#L200-L202[does not have a BIOS boot partition] because 4k native disks are https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/hard-drives-and-partitions#advanced-format-drives[only supported with UEFI].

== What's the difference between Ignition and Butane configurations?

Ignition configuration is a low-level interface used to define the whole set of customizations for an instance.
It is primarily meant as a machine-friendly interface, with content encoded as JSON and a fixed structure defined via JSON Schema.
This JSON configuration is processed by each FCOS instance upon first boot.

Many high-level tools exist that can produce an Ignition configuration starting from their own specific input formats,
such as `terraform`, `matchbox`, `openshift-installer`, and Butane.

Butane is one such high-level tool.
It is primarily meant as a human-friendly interface, thus defining its own richer configuration entries and using YAML documents as input.
This YAML configuration is never directly processed by FCOS instances (only the resulting Ignition configuration is).

Although similar, Ignition configurations and Butane ones do not have the same structure; thus, converting between them is not just a direct YAML-to-JSON translation, but it involves additional logic.
Butane exposes several customization helpers (e.g. distribution specific entries and common abstractions) that are not present in Ignition and make the formats not interchangeable.
Additionally, the different formats (YAML for Butane, JSON for Ignition) help to avoid mixing up inputs by mistake.

== What is the format of the version number?

This is covered in detail in the https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/blob/main/Design.md#version-numbers[design docs].

The summary is that Fedora CoreOS uses the format `X.Y.Z.A`

* `X` is the Fedora major version (i.e. `32`)
* `Y` is the datestamp that the package set was snapshotted from Fedora (i.e. `20200715`)
* `Z` is a code number used by official builds
** `1` for the `next` stream
** `2` for the `testing` stream
** `3` for the `stable` stream
* `A` is a revision number that is incremented for each new build with the same `X.Y.Z` parameters

The version numbering scheme is subject to change and is not intended to be parsed by machine.

== Why is the `dnsmasq.service` systemd unit masked?

We have found that the dnsmasq binary can be used for several host
applications, including podman and NetworkManager. For this reason we
include the dnsmasq package in the base OSTree layer, but we discourage
the use of the `dnsmasq.service` in the host by masking it with
`systemctl mask dnsmasq.service`.

_"Why do you mask the service?"_

dnsmasq is useful for running a DHCP/DNS/TFTP server for external clients
(i.e. not local to the host), too, but that is something we'd prefer users
to do in a container. Putting the service in a container insulates the
hosted service from breakage as a result of host layer changes. For
example, if NetworkManager and podman stopped using dnsmasq, we would
remove it from the host and the service you depend on would cease to
work.

_"But, I really want to use it!"_

We don't recommend it, but if you really want to use it you can just
unmask and enable it:

.Example Butane config for unmasking dnsmasq.service
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
variant: fcos
version: {butane-latest-stable-spec}
systemd:
  units:
    - name: dnsmasq.service
      mask: false
      enabled: true
----

For more information see
https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/519[the tracker issue discussion].

== Why do I get SELinux denials after updates if I have local policy modifications?

Currently, the OSTree and SELinux tooling conflict a bit. If you have
permanently applied local policy modifications then policy updates
delivered by the OS will no longer apply; your policy stays frozen.
This means any policy "fixes" needed to enable new functionality will
not get applied. See
https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/701[coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker#701]
for more details.

This means you may see denials like the following, which can take down critical parts
of a system like in
https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/700[coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker#700]:

.Example SELinux denial
[source, text]
----
systemd-resolved[755]: Failed to symlink /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf: Permission denied
audit[755]: AVC avc:  denied  { create } for  pid=755 comm="systemd-resolve" name=".#stub-resolv.confc418434d59d7d93a" scontext=system_u:system_r:systemd_resolved_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:systemd_resolved_var_run_t:s0 tclass=lnk_file permissive=0
----

To see if your system currently has local policy modifications you can
run `ostree admin config-diff`. The following system has a modified
policy:

.Example system with a modified SELinux policy
[source, text]
----
$ sudo ostree admin config-diff | grep selinux/targeted/policy
M    selinux/targeted/policy/policy.32
----

To work around this incompatibility, please attempt to apply policy
modifications dynamically. For example, for an SELinux boolean you can use the
following systemd unit that executes on every boot:

.Example Butane config for dynamically applying SELinux boolean
[source,yaml,subs="attributes"]
----
variant: fcos
version: {butane-latest-stable-spec}
systemd:
  units:
    - name: setsebool.service
      enabled: true
      contents: |
        [Service]
        Type=oneshot
        ExecStart=setsebool container_manage_cgroup true
        RemainAfterExit=yes
        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

If your system's basic functionality has stopped working because of
SELinux denials check to see if your system currently has local policy
modifications. You can check with `ostree admin config-diff`:

.Example system with a modified SELinux policy
[source, text]
----
$ sudo ostree admin config-diff | grep selinux/targeted/policy
M    selinux/targeted/policy/policy.32
----

If your system is in this state you have two options:

* Re-deploy starting with the latest image artifacts.
** This means you start with the latest policy.
* Follow the workaround in https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/701[coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker#701] to restore the base policy.

== Why is the `systemd-repart.service` systemd unit masked?

https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-repart.html[system-repart]
is a tool to grow and add partitions to a partition table. On Fedora CoreOS, we
only support using Ignition to create partitions, filesystems and mount points,
thus systemd-repart is masked by default.

Ignition runs on first boot in the initramfs and is aware of Fedora CoreOS
specific disk layout. It is also capable of reconfiguring the root filesystem
(from xfs to ext4 for example), setting up LUKS, etc... See the
xref:storage.adoc[Configuring Storage] page for examples.

See the xref:faq.adoc#_why_is_the_dnsmasq_service_systemd_unit_masked[Why is the `dnsmasq.service` systemd unit masked]
entry for an example config to unmask this unit.

== How do I keep dropped wireless firmware?

Some Wi-Fi firmware blbos were split into sub-packages in Fedora 39 and Fedora 40. Fedora Cores OS will keep them in until Fedora 41, but display a warning message in the console if NetworkManager-wifi is layered without any other wifi firmware packages having a layering request.

If `NetworkManager-wifi` is a requested layered package, a warning is displayed to encourage users to also request a WiFi firmware package to prevent disrupted connectivity.

To request the Wi-Fi firmware stay installed even when Fedora CoreOS drops these packages please follow the xref:sysconfig-enabling-wifi.adoc#_on_an_existing_fedora_coreos_system[steps to perform Wi-Fi enablement on an existing system].

Once the packages are requested you can now disable the warning so it won't be checked on subsequent boots.
