= Kernel tunables (sysctl)

The Linux kernel offers a plethora of knobs under `/proc/sys` to control the availability of different features and tune performance parameters.

Values under `/proc/sys` can be changed directly at runtime, but such changes will not be persisted across reboots.
Persistent settings should be written under `/etc/sysctl.d/` during provisioning, in order to be applied on each boot.

As an example, the xref:producing-ign.adoc[Butane] snippet below shows how to disable _SysRq_ keys:
