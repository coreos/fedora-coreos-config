##     There are 2 services: 
##     1)ignition-delete-config.service, which deletes Ignition 
##     configs from VMware and VirtualBox on first boot.
##     2)coreos-ignition-delete-config.service, do the same thing 
##     on existing machines on upgrade, using a stamp file in /var/lib 
##     to avoid multiple runs.
##     Ideally we'd test on virtualbox and vmware, but we don't have tests
##     there, so we mock specifically for ignition.platform.id=qemu.
##     Test scenarios:
##     On first boot, verify that both 2 services ran. 
##     On upgrade boot, verify that 1) should not run, 2) should run.
##     On normal boot, verify that both 2 services should not run.
##     On upgrade boot with 2) masked, verify that both 2 services 
##     should not run.
