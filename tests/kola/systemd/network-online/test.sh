# If the user provides a systemd unit which pulls in `network-online.target`,
# we want to make sure that logins don't block on `network-online.target` being
# reached. `block-network-online.service` verifies this by pulling in `network-
# online.target` and preventing it from being reached by running `Before=` it
# and sleeping forever.

# We hit this in RHCOS with iscsi.service causing network-online.target to block
# remote-fs-pre.target and hence systemd-user-sessions.service from running:

# The fact that we're here means that `systemd-user-sessions.service` was

# some sanity-checks to verify that the test was valid.

# verify that block-network-online.service is still activating since it's stuck sleeping
