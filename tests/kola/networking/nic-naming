##   description: Verify that we detected eth* NIC naming after booted.
##     Disable on azure because of a limitation of the hv_netvsc driver
##     there. According to [1] and [2] the driver does not provide sufficient
##     information to systemd-udev for systemd's naming to work. It falls
##     back to basic ethX naming.
