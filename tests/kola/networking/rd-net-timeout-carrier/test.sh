# This test verifies that NetworkManager supports configuring the
# carrier timeout via the `rd.net.timeout.carrier=` karg. Without
# recreating an environment that requires this setting to be set
# (which would be hard to do), we'll test this by just making sure
# that setting the kernel argument ensures the runtime configuration
# file /run/NetworkManager/conf.d/15-carrier-timeout.conf gets created.
#
# Checking that this file gets created is also tricky because we
# `rm -rf /run/NetworkManager` in coreos-teardown-initramfs on first boot,
# so we'll workaround that by setting the karg permanently and then
# performing a reboot so we can check on the second boot if the file exists.
