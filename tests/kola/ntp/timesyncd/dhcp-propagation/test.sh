# and other for the container(dnsmasq server). This setup will be helpful
# to verify the DHCP propagation of NTP servers. This will also avoid any
# regression that might cause in RHCOS or FCOS when the upstream changes
# come down and obsolete the temporary work (https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-config/pull/412)
