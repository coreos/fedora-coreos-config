# LVM uses devices listed in this file.
#
# This is an empty lvmdevices(8) file placed here by the CoreOS overlays.
# The existence of the file prevents LVM from auto-activating any LVM devices
# that aren't explicitly allowlisted by being added to this file. Any newly
# added PV/VG devices that get created via pvcreate/vgreate will have an entry
# added here automatically by the tools. For more information on this see
# https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/1517
