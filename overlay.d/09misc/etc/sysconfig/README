This directory is a legacy of Red Hat Linux days.
Do not write new software that uses configuration
files here.  Instead your software should use a regular
config file in `/etc/foo.conf`, a configuration directory
such as `/etc/foo/`.

Where appropriate, it's also best practice to use "systemd style config"
where default config files live in `/usr/lib/foo` that can be
overridden in `/etc` and `/run`.
