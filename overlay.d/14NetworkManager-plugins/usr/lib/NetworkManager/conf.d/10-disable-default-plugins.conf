# Stop NetworkManager from trying to load the ifcfg-rh plugin by default,
# which we don't ship.  This actually disables all default plugins, of which
# ifcfg-rh is currently the only one.  
#
# Note that we must do this for now because `-=` syntax doesn't work
# with compiled-in defaults. Proposed upstream fix:
# https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/-/merge_requests/491
