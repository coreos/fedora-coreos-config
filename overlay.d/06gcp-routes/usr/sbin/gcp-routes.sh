# Update iptables rules based on google cloud load balancer VIPS
#
# This is needed because the GCP L3 load balancer doesn't actually do DNAT; 
# the destination IP address is still the VIP. Normally, there is an agent that
# adds the vip to the local routing table, tricking the kernel in to thinking
# it's a local IP and allowing processes doing an accept(0.0.0.0) to receive
# the packets. Clever.
#
# We don't do that. Instead, we DNAT with conntrack. This is so we don't break
# existing connections when the vip is removed. This is useful for draining
# connections - take ourselves out of the vip, but service existing conns.
#
# Additionally, clients can write a file to /run/gcp-routes/$IP.down to force
# a VIP as down. This is useful for graceful shutdown / upgrade.
