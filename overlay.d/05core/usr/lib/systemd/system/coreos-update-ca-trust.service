# This service is currently specific to Fedora CoreOS,
# but we may want to add it to the base OS in the future.
# The idea here is to allow users to just drop in CA roots
# via Ignition without having to know to run the special
# update command.

# We want to run quite early, in particular before anything
# that may speak TLS to external services.  In the future,
# it may make sense to do this in the initramfs too.
DefaultDependencies=no
# This ensures we run after important bits like ostree-prepare-root.service
