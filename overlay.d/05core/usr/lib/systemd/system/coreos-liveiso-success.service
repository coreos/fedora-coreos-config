# The logic here is that we're doing a streaming journalctl query (-f to follow)
# and the `| head` bit will cause the pipeline to wait until at least one line is
# emitted, which will happen when a user login starts.  We then just write a static
# message to the virtio channel, which https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler/pull/1330
# knows how to read.
