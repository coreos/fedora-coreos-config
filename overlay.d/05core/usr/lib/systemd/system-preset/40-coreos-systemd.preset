# We don't have swap by default, and systemd-oomd hard requires it.

# Disable systemd-firstboot because it conflicts with Ignition.
# In most cases this is handled via the remove-from-packages
# bits in the manifest (ignition-and-ostree.yaml), but
# we want to support overlaying builds of systemd from git.
disable systemd-firstboot.service

# This hasn't been tested with ostree/rpm-ostree and heavily overlaps
# with the latter.  Preemptively disable the service; it will hopefully
# be subpackaged though for Fedora.
