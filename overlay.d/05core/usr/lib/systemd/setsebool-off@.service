# This service is currently specific to CoreOS distros,
# but we may want to add it to the base OS in the future.
# The idea here is to allow users to set SELinux booleans
# without having to modify the on-disk policy, by enabling
# the appropriate systemd service via Ignition
[Unit]
Description=Turn OFF SELinux boolean %I
# We want to run quite early, in particular before anything
# that may require any access permitted by the boolean;
# it may make sense to do this in the initramfs too.
