# This unit will run very early before the dracut-cmdline
# service and detect if we want to request dracut bring up
# networking or not. We do want to request networking if:
#
# - the user is booting the live ISO
# - the user didn't already request networking via rd.neednet
# - the user provided a ignition.config.url karg, implying
#   the need for networking
#
# As of recently we skip networking if a config is injected via
# `coreos-installer iso embed` in order to allow automating
# installs on networks without DHCP.
#
# If we do determine we need network and there are no other
# `ip=` kargs then we'll use `ip=dhcp,dhcp6` by default.
#
# The requesting of network will be done by writing relevant
# dracut networking args into /etc/cmdline.d/coreos-live-network-kargs.conf
# so that it gets picked up by the dracut networking scripts later
# on in boot.
#
# This is all done because we want to support a mode where
# the user can boot the live ISO and get to an interactive
# prompt without requiring networking on boot. The user can
# then configure the networking interactively.
