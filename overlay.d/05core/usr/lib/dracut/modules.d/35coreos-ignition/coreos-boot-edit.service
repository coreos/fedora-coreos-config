# This unit will run late in the initrd process after Ignition is completed
# successfully and temporarily mount /boot read-write to make edits
# (e.g. removing firstboot networking configuration files if necessary).

[Unit]
Description=CoreOS Boot Edit
ConditionPathExists=/usr/lib/initrd-release

# Since we are mounting /boot, require the device first. This isn't strictly
# necessary since we run late, but on principle let's make clear the dependency.
Requires=dev-disk-by\x2dlabel-boot.device
After=dev-disk-by\x2dlabel-boot.device
# Start after Ignition has finished
After=ignition-files.service
# As above, this isn't strictly necessary, but on principle.

# MountFlags=slave is so the umount of /boot is guaranteed to happen.
