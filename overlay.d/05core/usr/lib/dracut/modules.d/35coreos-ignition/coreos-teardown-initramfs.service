[Unit]
Description=CoreOS Tear Down Initramfs
DefaultDependencies=false

# We want to run the teardown after all other Ignition stages
# have run because some platforms (like Packet) do remote status
# reporting for each Ignition stage. Since we are tearing down
# the networking using an ExecStop we need to make sure we run
# the ExecStop *after* any other ignition*.service unit's ExecStop.
# The only other one right now is ignition-mount that has an ExecStop
# for doing an unmount. Since the ordering for ExecStop is the
# opposite of ExecStart we need to use `Before=ignition-mount.service`.
# https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/440
Before=ignition-mount.service
Before=ignition-complete.target

# Make sure ExecStop= runs before we switch root
Conflicts=initrd-switch-root.target umount.target
Before=initrd-switch-root.target

OnFailure=emergency.target
OnFailureJobMode=isolate

# If we are already heading towards emergency.target
# then don't try to stop this unit because it will fail
# when trying to access files in /sysroot/etc/. The failure
# is mostly harmless but having the extra error messages
# leads us away from the original problem.
