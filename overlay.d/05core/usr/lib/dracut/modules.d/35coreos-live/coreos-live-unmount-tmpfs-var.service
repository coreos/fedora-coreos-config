# If the user specified a persistent /var, ideally it'd just be mounted
# overtop of our tmpfs /var and everything would be fine.  That works
# fine in the initramfs, where ignition-mount handles the mounting.
# But in the real root, the user's mount unit is ignored by systemd,
# since there's already a filesystem mounted on /var.  To fix this, we
# notice that the user wants to mount /var, and unmount our tmpfs /var
# before switching roots.
