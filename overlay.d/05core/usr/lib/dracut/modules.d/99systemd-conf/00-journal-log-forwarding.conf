# For now we are using kmsg for multiplexing output to
# multiple console devices during early boot.
# 
# We do not want to use kmsg in the future as there may be sensitive
# ignition data that leaks to non-root users (by reading the kernel
# ring buffer using `dmesg`). In the future we will rely on kernel
# console multiplexing (link below) for this and will not use kmsg.
