# We don't support root on NFS, so we don't need it in the initramfs. It also
# conflicts with /var mount support in ignition because NFS tries to mount stuff
# in /var/ and then ignition can't cleanly unmount it. For example:
# https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut/blob/1856ae95c873a6fe855b3dccd0144f1a96b9e71c/modules.d/95nfs/nfs-start-rpc.sh#L7
# See also discussion in https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-config/pull/60
# Further, we currently do not use LVM, iSCSI or dmraid
omit_dracutmodules+=" nfs lvm iscsi dmraid "
# More storage modules we don't use
omit_dracutmodules+=" fcoe fcoe-uefi nbd "
# We use NetworkManager
omit_dracutmodules+=" systemd-networkd network-legacy network-wicked "
# We use systemd network naming
omit_dracutmodules+=" biosdevname "
# Random stuff we don't want
omit_dracutmodules+=" dbus-daemon memstrack "
