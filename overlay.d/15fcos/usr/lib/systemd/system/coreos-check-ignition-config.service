Description=Check if Ignition config is provided
# Only perform checks on the first (Ignition) boot as they are
# mostly useful only on that boot. This ensures systems started
# before Ignition/Afterburn started logging structured data don't
# get misleading messages. Also handles the case where the journal
# gets rotated and no longer has the structured log messages.
